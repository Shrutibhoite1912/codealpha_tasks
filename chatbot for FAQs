# FAQ Matcher + Simple Chat UI

This project shows how to:
- Collect FAQs (faqs.json).
- Preprocess text using spaCy (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal).
- Match user queries to FAQs using TF-IDF + cosine similarity or semantic embeddings (SentenceTransformers).
- Provide a simple Streamlit chat UI.

Requirements:
1. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install spaCy language model:
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   # optional, for better quality and performance:
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf

4. If you want semantic embeddings, ensure sentence-transformers installed (already in requirements) and the model will be downloaded automatically when first used.

Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

How it works:
- FAQMatcher preprocesses questions with spaCy, builds a TF-IDF matrix (or embeddings),
  and computes cosine similarity between the input question and stored FAQ questions.
- The Streamlit UI allows entering a question and returns the best-matching FAQ answer along with a similarity score.
- Use the "Use semantic embeddings" option to switch to sentence-transformers for better semantic matching across paraphrases.

Extensions / Improvements:
- Add more FAQs (faqs.json), or store in a DB.
- Add fallback escalation when similarity < some threshold (e.g., create a ticket).
- Use an intent classifier (sklearn or a fine-tuned model) for routing to different FAQ subsets.
- Use Faiss or Milvus for scalable nearest-neighbor search on embeddings if you have many FAQs.
- Add context handling and multi-turn conversation memory in the UI.
